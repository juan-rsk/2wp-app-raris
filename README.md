# 2wp-app
This is the front end application for 2-Way-Peg solution.
The solution will be a **web interface (this app)**, which integrates with a Rest API, which in turn communicates with internal services such as the blockchain node and databases. In addition, a daemon/worker will be created that will be responsible for obtaining data from the blockchain and changing the status of the transaction.
